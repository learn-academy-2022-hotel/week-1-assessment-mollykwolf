# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a software and is local. Github is a platform that lives on the interent and is remote. 

Researched answer: Git is a verison control system for tracking modifications in code. It allows for collaboration among programmers. Github is a cloud-based hosting service that allows managing and storing Git repositories. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: A Boolean value will return true or false. They represent the value of true or false and are not strings. 

Researched answer: The three types of logical operators that will return a  Boolean value are eqaulity (== or ===), logical (&&, ||, or !), and relational operators (<,>,>=,<=). 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the position of a element in an array. An index is different from the value, because the value is the element itselt in the array. Values can be a string, boolen, number, or symbol. 

Researched answer:

Every value in an array has a particular location known as the index. Indexes are sequential numbers that tell you the position of the element in the array. The content of each element is called the value. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Array is a data type that stores a set of elements of the same data type. Strings are a set of characters. Arrays and strings share similar properties such as .length and .concast. and indexOf. They differ because strings can only store characters while an array stores data types. 

Researched answer: Arrays can contain any type of information as long as it is a data type JavaScript recognizes. A string is a primitive data type that can contain numbers, text, words, etc. as long as it is wrapped in quatation makrs. Arrays and Strings share similar properties. You can combine arrays and strings (.concat). You can determine the length (.length) and both have the index property. There are a few differences though. Array size is fixed, while string size is not, and arrays are data structure that hold a collection of the same data type, while a string is a collection of characters.  

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is a technique used by developers where they are two people working together to solve the same problem. One programmer drives while the other navigates. The driver is resposible for typing the code in a text editor and the navigator tells the driver what to code. 

Researched answer: Pair programming is a software developemnt technique in which two programmers work together. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed. THe two programmers swicth roles frequently. There are benefits from pair programming. Pair Programming is a way to learn from another coder and helps build a team environment.
## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function

2. Jest: is a JavaScript testing framework

3. Objects: are variables, but objects can contain many vaules. 

4. Method: is a property contaning a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties. 

5. Classes: JavaScript class is not a object. It is a template for JavaScript objects.
